Important Notes:
⚠️ Legal Disclaimer: Only use this for legitimate Office licenses you own. Microsoft's licensing terms should be respected.

⚠️ KMS Servers: The KMS server (e8.us.to) might not always be available. You may need to find alternative KMS servers.

⚠️ Administrator Rights: This absolutely requires administrator privileges to work.

The enhanced version includes better error handling and retry logic, which is helpful since KMS activation can sometimes fail due to server issues.
